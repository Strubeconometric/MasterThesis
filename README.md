This projected was created for a master thesis at University of Duisburg-Essen to ensure scientific transparency criteria.

download all content into this folder (click on Code -> Download as Zip)

create three subfolders inside the parent folder: "output", "data_raw", and "data_tidy"

move all csv.files into the data_raw folder

open the R file and make sure that the working directory/here/project file is located inside the parent folder

follow the instructions in the R script and run the code

check the output folder for regression tables, descriptive tables, and illustrations
